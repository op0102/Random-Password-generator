# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Assumptions:

In the development process, I made the following sensible assumptions:

* "I assume a default password length of 12 characters for the random password generation."
* "I assume that by default, the preference for including numbers, alphabets, and special characters in the generated password is set to 'true'."
