# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Implementation Summary:

I have developed a Random Password Generator application using React JS. The application meets all the specified requirements:

Random Password Generation: Users can customize the generated password by including numbers, alphabets, and special characters.

Display Generated Password: The generated password is displayed to the user in real-time.

Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard with a single click.

Last 5 Passwords History: The application keeps track of the last 5 passwords generated by the user and displays them on the interface.

Local Storage: I have utilized local storage to store the user's previous passwords for reference.

User-Friendly Interface: I make it simple design and user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience.



Assumptions:

In the development process, I made the following sensible assumptions:

* "I assume a default password length of 12 characters for the random password generation."
* "I assume that by default, the preference for including numbers, alphabets, and special characters in the generated password is set to 'true'."
